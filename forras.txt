Holden Astra

The Holden Astra is a compact car marketed by Holden. Spanning six generations, the original, Australia-only Astra of 1984 was a derivative of the locally produced Nissan Pulsar, as was the 1987 Astra. It was succeeded by the Holden Nova in 1989â€”another unique-to-Australia model line.
